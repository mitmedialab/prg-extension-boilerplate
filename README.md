# prg-extension-boilerplate

Looking for the repository for [RAISE Playground](https://playground.raise.mit.edu/) development? It has been renamed to [prg-raise-playground](https://github.com/mitmedialab/prg-raise-playground).

This repo exists to enable re-directs from previously saved URLs that used a github pages link that referenced the old repository name (e.g. [https://mitmedialab.github.io/prg-extension-boilerplate/create/]).
